# Ecommerce-Analysis-Project
The project involves performing an in-depth analysis of customer data from an Ecommerce company to determine whether the company should prioritize its mobile app or website experience. This will include building a linear regression model and visualizing key relationships to uncover trends in customer behaviors, such as time spent on the mobile app and website, and their impact on yearly spending.
A key part of the analysis will focus on evaluating the contributions of both platforms to customer engagement and overall spending. By understanding these patterns, we will provide actionable insights that will help guide the company's strategy to improve user experience and drive future growth.
